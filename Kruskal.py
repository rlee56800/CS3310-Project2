Task #3 – Kruskal’s Algorithm (40 Pts)
Use greedy approach to find the MST of a graph using Kruskal’s algorithm .

Please make sure to use the disjoint set method explained in the class.
For more information on this method please check Appendix C of the course textbook.

INPUT:

    Read the weights of all the edges on the graph (adjacency matrix) from an input.txt file.
        You can use the following adjacency matrix as your reference; however, your program
        should be able to work with any graph size.

OUTPUT: 

    Print the list of all the edges in MST and the total cost of MST.
